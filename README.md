# atomgame - an in-development Atomas clone
###### evolution branch - changes made to accomodate the fabled GUI clone that is in progress i think

This is still kind of early and unfinished so don't expect anything. Original game concept by Sirnic. There is no GUI yet and this project probably won't feature one instead i'll be making a separate game with more modes and stuff that will be its own repo and just use this as a library
